## Learning Objectives
Our goal with this coding assignment and accompanying material is to teach time series analysis, both modeling and forecasting, under the umbrella of system identification. In the standard system identification problem, such as controlling a robot, we have the state transition equation:

In ARIMA modeling, we have a similar equation:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;ARIMA(p,%20d,%20q)%20=%20(1%20-%20\phi_{1}L%20-%20\phi_{2}L^{2}%20-%20\phi_{3}L^{3}...%20-%20\phi_{p}L^{p})%20(1%20-%20L)^{d}%20y_{t}%20=%20c%20+%20(1%20+%20\theta_{1}%20L%20+%20\theta_{2}%20L^{2}...%20+%20\theta_{q}%20L^{q})%20\epsilon_{t}" title="test" />

where L is the lag operator, s.t. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;Ly_{t}%20=%20y_{t-1}" title="Ly_{t} = y_{t-1}" /> and phi and theta are parameters that define our model. We notice a large difference between these two formulations, with the user input in the original system identification problem being replaced with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;\epsilon_{t}" title="test" />, which is a residual that comes from a certain level of noise in the data instead of user input.

We explore how to remove trends from time series data formulated as
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;X_{t}%20=%20m_{t}%20+%20\epsilon_{t}" title="test" />

using both differencing and regressions. We then see how the ARIMA model can be fit using least squares and iterative maximum likelihood estimation, which follows the same pattern as K-means clustering, in order to find the best parameters to define our model.

We finally go explore how to choose good hyperparameters for the model p, d, and q, and how to evaluate the model.
